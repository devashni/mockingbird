Don’t threaten people Joe!",  "I am happy to announce that the original Apprentice --which will offer job opportunities to those in need--is coming back.",  Thank you so much. That's so nice. Isn't he a great guy. He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it. It's just not fair. And I have to tell you I'm here,  and very strongly here,  because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United,  David and everybody,  and tremendous resect for the Tea Party. Also,  also the people of Iowa. They have something in common. Hard-working people. They want to work,  they want to make the country great. I love the people of Iowa. So that's the way it is. Very simple. With that said,  our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job. The world is collapsing around us,  and many of the problems we've caused. Our president is either grossly incompetent,  a word that more and more people are using,  and I think I was the first to use it,  or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about,  which could be possible. In any event,  Washington is broken,  and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray. Very simple. Politicians are all talk,  no action. They are all talk and no action. And it's constant; it never ends. And I'm a conservative,  actually very conservative,  and I'm a Republican. And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians. Because they let the president get away with absolute murder. You see always,  oh we're going to do this,  we're going to--. Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens. You look at Obamacare. A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '  and it is going to be a disaster. People are closing up shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend of mine who's a doctor,  a very good doctor,  a very successful guy. He said,  I have more accountants than I have patients. And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business. And he was very successful guy. But it's happening more and more. Look at Obamacare with a $ billion website. I have many websites,  many,  many websites. They're all over the place. But for $ ,  okay? Now everything about Obamacare was a lie. It was a filthy lie. And when you think about it,  lies,  I mean are they prosecuted? Does anyone do anything? And what are the Republican politicians doing about it? He lied about the doctor,  he lied about every aspect. You can keep your plan. And you've all heard that hundreds of times. That's like the real estate location,  location. I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location,  location. But you have heard this about Obamacare. And it's disgraceful. It's a big,  fat,  horrible lie. Your deductibles are going through the roof. You're not going to get--unless you're hit by an army tank,  you're not going to get coverage. And people that had plans that they loved,  that they really loved,  don't have those plans anymore. So it's a real,  real disaster. And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare. And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it. Now,  we have to build a fence. And it's got to be a beauty. Who can build better than Trump? I build; it's what I do. I build; I build nice fences,  but I build great buildings. Fences are easy,  believe me. I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border. They're walking. The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front,  coming into our country. It is so terrible. It is so unfair. It is so incompetent. And we don't have the best coming in. We have people that are criminals,  we have people that are crooks. You can certainly have terrorists. You can certainly have Islamic terrorists. You can have anything coming across the border. We don't do anything about it. So I would say that if I run and if I win,  I would certainly start by building a very,  very powerful border. Again,  the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it. Benghazi. Oh,  Benghazi,  Benghazi. Everything is Benghazi. What happens? Nothing. IRS,  e-mails. I get sued all the time,  okay. I run a big business. You know I've always said it's very,  very hard for a person who is very successful. I have done so many deals. Almost all of them have been tremendously successful. You'll see that when I file my statements. I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me,  okay. But I've always said,  and I said it strongly,  it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics,  run for political office,  any office,  let alone president. Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many-- Look,  Obama,  what did he do? No deal. He never did a deal. He did one deal. A house. And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now,  okay. He got away with murder. But I can tell you,  e-mails. IRS,  the e-mails,  thousands of them,  they were lost; they were lost. If you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost; they can't be lost. So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are? They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it. Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great. But they talk about it. And then you have a president that does an executive order. Nobody even heard of an executive order. He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders. Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing,  and he's been saying it for a long time; he said,  I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier. Instead they have a weak lawsuit,  that probably the time it's finished,  I know so much about this,  six,  seven,  eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it. We'll be into a different mode,  and our country will be further destroyed. So we have to do something. Jobs. China. I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese. One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese,  and they respect me for it. And I know them. And they say,  we can't believe what we're getting away with. We can't believe how stupid your leaders are. They tell me that. Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it,  but why not. But they tell me that. And by the way,  especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods,  I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries. The Euro,  China is going crazy with the devaluation. I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing. They are devaluing down to nothing. And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete. And they're getting away with it. And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago,  but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it. But you watch this devaluation of all of it. I mean the Euro,  China,  Mexico; everybody is devaluing. And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger,  it sounds good. You know it's one of those things,  sounds good. Be very careful. Be very careful. Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing. They have it set. Don't forget another thing. China became the number one economic power a year ago. That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen. It was absolutely unthinkable. So it happened and it's very,  very sad. Now we spent $ trillion in Iraq. We got nothing. They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us. Until they started getting their ass kicked,  and call,  oh please come back and help us. We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms,  ISIS. By the way,  you know how they formed. They took the oil. And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years,  keep the oil. So now ISIS has the oil. And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have,  Iran is going to take. So we get nothing. We have $ trillion and we have thousands of lives lost,  thousands,  and we have,  what do we have. I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors,  incredible people. And we have to help those people,  we have to help our vets,  we have to help our military,  we have to build our military. But,  and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast. We have incompetent people. They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing. It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we do that,  so we can save Social Security. 'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security. I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded,  and Medicare and Medicaid. Get rid of the waste,  get rid of the fraud,  but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security. And like,  I like Congressman Ryan,  I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security,  and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue. It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it,  and so you can afford military,  and all of the other things. Now,  we have a game changer now,  and the game changer is nuclear weapons. We really do have to get strong,  and we have to get strong fast. We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We can't do it. Can't do it. We cannot let that happen. You know in the old days,  I would have said   years ago,   years ago,   years ago,  pull out and let them fight each other. Here we are in Syria. We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria. Think of this. We're fighting ISIS,  but ISIS wants to overturn the government. Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains,  okay. But think of it; think of it. ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them,  but we want Syria to fall. There are so many things; there are so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with,  that we never really had to think about too much before,  other than a certain number of years ago,  is the nuclear. Nuclear today,  it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles. You can take out the East Coast of this country,  you can take out large sections of the Midwest,  you can take out things that were unthinkable. The power. And we have to be in a position where that never,  ever,  ever,  every happens. We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there. We're trying to do the right thing. We have leadership,  again--no leadership respects us. You know,  leadership of other places never respect stupid people,  okay,  that's one thing you're going to find. The same thing is happening there. And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so,  Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals,  different,  not the oil,  but minerals. And we're fighting here,  and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals. They're taking it out. Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals. So we're fighting here and they are taking it out,  looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker. It's really,  really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country. If we don't-- The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed. Bridges are collapsing all over the country. The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable,  what's happening with our infrastructure. I go to Saudi Arabia,  I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai. I go to various different places. I go to China. They are building a bridge on every corner. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff. They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen. They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say "cutter" but I've always said "qatar" so I'll keep it "qatar" what the hell. But they're building,  they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen,  in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen. And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes. The place is falling apart. You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart. And they have a hole in it,  and they replace it with asphalt. So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place. This is inside,  not outside. And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen. In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor. I said it's not an honor; they're just smart. But you look at LAX,  and you look at Kennedy Airport,  and you look at our airports generally,  you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad-- I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say,  but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails. You know the guard rails. The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always bent,  rusted and horrible. Did you ever see more than like  feet which isn't corroded,  or bent or the heat,  if it gets too hot,  it just crushes. Now they've been selling this thing for  years. Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works. Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening. Somebody made a lot of money on that. They don't know what is happening. So we have to make our country great again. We have to rebuild our country. And we have a long way to go. We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money. Now we owe it to the Chinese,  a lot of it. We owe it to other countries. They're the ones that hold the debt. And then we give them money. We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies. I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know-- No American company comes to see and comes to bid. It's South Korea,  and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships,  we send the destroyers,  we send our airplanes,  we're going to protect them. What are we doing; why aren't they paying us? Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing? I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time,  for some reason it's South Korea. You know whether it's China,  South Korea,  but in this case televisions,  South Korea. Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on? Now,  we have a very important election coming up. We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people. Nobody like Trump of course,  but these are minor details. We have some good people. It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed. He failed. I mean I liked him. Look--like him,  dislike him--the % statement that he made,  that's not going away. The Romneycare from Massachusetts,  that's not going away. What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time. It's not fair because it was a long t-- That doesn't work. But more importantly,  he choked. Something happened to him in the last month. He had that election won. And let me tell you something. That election,  sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal. I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line,  they go ah,  ah I can't close it. Or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament. And there are many of them. Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that. You can't give somebody another chance,  'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president. I really do. I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up,  which is sad to say but true. So you can't have Romney. He choked. You can't have Bush. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now I made that statement very strongly,  and now every one says the last thing-- You know they copied it. I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing. But I said it. I was the one that said it first,  and I mean it. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now,  he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster,  that's bad,  it should be local and all of that. But he's totally in favor of Common Core. He's very,  very weak on immigration. Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love. I say,  what? Come for love? You've got these people coming,  half of them are criminals. They're coming for love? They're coming for a lot of other reasons,  and it's not love. And when he runs,  you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama. I was never a big fan,  but his brother gave us Obama. 'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months. And then he appointed Justice Roberts. And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts. And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes. So you can't have Jeb Bush. And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win. So Mitt and--you just can't have those two. That's it. That's it. It's so simple. So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important. And I watch these teleprompters,  and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter,  because we got one that uses teleprompters. And people say,  oh he is so quick on his feet. He is reading it. I mean give me a break. Everything is read. You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless''']

Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!  Run away! Run away!
Aaaaugh! Stop saying the word!
Aaaugh!
Aah,  but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
Aaugh!  Wait! I said it! I said it! Ooh!
Action!
Ah but it would get round to close harmony,  wouldn’t it?
Ah,  now we see the violence inherent in the system.
Ah,  thanks very much.
Ah,  this one is for your mother.  This one’s for your dad!
Ah! There you are!
Ah. W-well,  actually I am a Knight of the Round Table.
All right?
All right. We’ll call it a draw.
Am I right?
Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
And after the spanking...the oral sex.
And again...  Over we go! Good. Steady! And now,  the big one...  Ooof! Come on, 
And Bors. That’s five.
And don’t apologize! Every time I try to talk to someone it’s “sorry this” and “forgive me that” and “I’m not worthy—” What are you doing now!?
And I want his only daughter to look upon me...as her own dad—in a very real,  and legally-binding sense.
And not too expensive.
And so King  gathered his knights together ... bringing from all the corners of the kingdom the strongest and bravest in the land ... To sit at The Round Table ...
And that,  my liege,  is how we know the Earth to be bananashaped.
And the Grail... The Grail is there?
And the hat... But she is a witch!
And therefore...?
And this isn’t my nose. It’s a false one.
And what do you burn apart from witches?
And you. Oh,  quick get the sword out. I want to cut his head off!
And you’ll come and get him.
Apples!
Are there? What are they?
Are those YOUR kidneys?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Are you sure he’s got one?
Are you sure that’s absolutely necessary?
Ask me the questions,  Bridge Keeper. I’m not afraid!
Away! away varletesses!  The beds here are warm and soft...and very,  very big.
B—B’cause they’re made of wood...?
bathing,  dressing,  undressing,  making exciting underwear.... [puts away torch
Be quiet!
Be quiet!
Be quiet! I order you to be quiet!
,  my liege.
Behold the cave of Caerbannog!
Bet you’re gay!
Bloody peasant!
Blue.
Brave Sir Robin,  you go.
Bread!
Bring her forward.
bring out cow.
Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead! Bring out your dead!
Build a bridge ou’ of ’er!
Burn her anyway!
Burn her! Burn her!
Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her!
Burn her! Burn! Burn her!
Burn her! Witch! Witch! Burn her!
Burn! Burn her!
Burn! Burn them up!
But all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting.
but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major—
But do they listen t’ me?
But Father,  I don’t want any of that.
But I don’t like her.
But I don’t want land.
But the Grail! Where is the Grail!?
But then,  of course,  African swallows are non-migra’ory.
But you are dressed as one.
But,  Father!
Buuuurn them!
By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs—
By what name are you known?
Camelot? Are you from,  uh,  Camelot?
Chicken! Chicken!
Come ’ere!
Come on you bastards! Sing close harmony!
Come on,  you pansy! Hah!
Come on!
Come,  Patsy.
Consult the Book of Armaments!
Cut down a tree with a herring? It can’t be done!
Dennis,  there’s some lovely filth down here Oh... How d’you do?
Did you dress her up like this?
Did you say ‘shrubberies’?
Didn’t mean to?! You put your sword right through his head!
Do they hurt?
Do you suppose he meant the Camauuuugh?
Does wood sink in water?
Don’t editorialize!
Don’t say that word!
Dramatically,  sir?
Dramatically!
Ector.
Exactly! So,  logically...
Farewell,  sweet Concorde!
Father. I’m Father.
Fiends! I’ll tear them apart!
Fine,  um,  I don’t want to waste anymore of your time,  but,  uh,  I don’t suppose you could, 
Follow!  But!  follow only if ye be men of valor,  fo’ the entrance to this
Found them? In Mercia? The coconut’s tropical!
Gawain.
Go and get ‘em!
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest. If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
God be praised!
Good idea,  O Lord!
Good luck,  brave Sir Launcelot. God be with you.
Good Sir knight,  will you come with me to Camelot,  and join us at the Round Table?
Good!
Great! 
Greetings,  King !
Greetings,  Tim the Enchanter.
GUARDS! Take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest tree in the kingdom!
HALT!
Halt! Who art thou?
Halt! Who goes there?
Have at you!
have mercy your MAJESTY!
Haw haw haw. Haw haw haw. Haw haw.
He hasn’t got shit all over him.
He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death. He asks each traveler five questions—
He isn’t. 
He must have died while carving it.
He said the word again!
He says they’ve already got one!
He’s come to rescue me,  father.
He’s getting better!
He’s not quite dead!
He’s not quite dead!
Heh heh heh. Stop! What is your name?  
Herbert. We live in a bloody swamp. We need all the land we can get.
Here,  he says he’s not dead!
Here’s one.
Hey! I’ve got a great idea. Why doesn’t Launcelot go?
Hic!
Hic!
Holy cow!
How can we not say the word if you don’t tell us what it is?
How do you do,  good lady. I am ,  king of the Britons. Whose castle is that?
How do you know she is a witch?
How does it,  uh... how does it work?
How you English say,  I one more time-a unclog my nose in your direction,  sons of a window-dresser! So,  you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent running-about advancing behavior! I wave my private parts at your aunties,  you cheesy lot of second-hand electric donkey bottom biters.
How?!
Hurry,  Sir Launcelot!
Hurry! I’m ready!
I am ,  King of the Britons.
I am ready!
I am your king!
I am.
I am. And this my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court of Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.
I bring greetings from the court of king Brian.
I can understand that.
I can’t take him...
I can’t.
I cannot tell. Suffice it to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.
I command you,  as king of the Britons,  to stand aside!
I did say sorry about the ‘old woman, ’ but from the behind you looked
I didn’t know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective.
I didn’t!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail!
I don’t know. Must be a king.
I don’t think I was.
I don’t wanna talk to you no more,  you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster,  and your father smelt of elderberries!
I don’t want to get too nit-picky,  here,  but Dennis did not in fact already say that he and his companions lived in an anarcho-syndicalist commune. Quite to the contrary,  as a matter of fact,  he said that they lived in a dictatorship,  while the woman said she thought they lived in an autonomous collective,  also a far cry from an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  which is a utopian state in which the workers own and manage their industries without need of laws or leaders. Moreover,  in remarking earlier that they live in a ‘self-perpetuating autocracy, ’ Dennis clearly admitted to living in an absolute monarchy (where a king has total,  unlimited power based on divine right),  which means he has a king. However,  the Dark Ages—and well into the Middle Ages—European states were in fact feudal monarchies,  in which the king had powers determined in part by the commitments he could exact from his barons,  and they from their lords—based,  ultimately,  on how much plunder the king could lead.
I don’t want to go in the cart!
I feel fine!
I feel happy... I feel happy!
I go’ better.
I have no quarrel with you,  good sir knight,  but I must cross this bridge.
I have to push the pram a lot!
I knew that someone would,  I knew that somewhere out there...there must be...
I know not,  my liege.
I know,  but I want the girl that I marry to have...a certain...
I mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of straight choral work?
I mean,  if I went around sayin’ I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me,  they’d put me away!
I move...for no man.
I never did!
I never!
I said don’t.
I seek the Grail! I have seen it,  here in this castle!
I think I’ll go for a walk!
I told you. We’re an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive-officer-for-the-week. 
I warned you!
I warned you! But did you listen to me? Oh,  no,  you knew it all,  didn’t you? Oh,  it’s just a harmless little
I was looking for it...
I’m afraid not!
I’m averting my eyes,  O Lord.
I’m French! Why do think I have this outraaageous accent,  you silly king!?
I’m getting better!
I’m invincible!
I’m not a witch. I’m not a witch.
I’m not dead!
I’m not dead!
I’m not interested!
I’m not!
I’m Sir Launcelot,  sir.
I’m thirty-seven.
I’m thirty-seven. I’m not old!
I’ve hurt worse.
Idiom,  sir?
Idiom!
If you do not agree to my commands,  then I shall
If you do not open this door,  we shall take this castle by force!
If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery,  my friend and I will say— We will say...‘ni’.
If you will not show us the Grail,  we shall take your castle by force!
If... she... weighs the same as a duck...she’s made of wood.
In that case I shall have to kill you.
In that case we shall just have to perform elsewhere. 
Is that clear?
Is there someone else up there we could talk to?
Isn’t there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?
It could be carried by an African swallow!
It could grip it by the husk!
It floats! It floats!
It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly. But there is one small problem.
It is ,  King of the Britons.
It is I,  ,  son of Uther Pendragon,  from the castle of Camelot,  king of the Britons,  defeator of the Saxons,  sovereign of all England!
It is King ,  and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this?
It reads,   “Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea. ‘He who is valiant and
It’s Aramaic! 
It’s not a question of where i’ grips it! It’s a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.
It’s not the real Grail?!
It’s not the same,  You thick-headed fool! 
It’s only a model.
Jesus Christ!
Just a flesh wound.

King of the who?
Knights of Ni,  we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
Knights,  I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride... to Camelot.
L-look,  I have seen it! It is here,  in the—
Leaving the room,  yes.
Let us taunt it! It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.
Let’s go!
Like with close harmony groups.
Listen,  Alice—
Listen,  in order to maintain air-speed velocity,  a swallow needs to beat its wings for’y-three times every second,  right?
Listen. Strange women lyin’ in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a
Look,  I do feel as a knight I should sample as much peril as I can.
Look,  I’ll have your leg. Right!
Look,  I’m fine!
Look,  it’s quite simple.
Look,  let me go back in there and face the peril.
Look,  my liege!
Look,  please!  In God’s name,  show me the Grail!
Look,  stop that.
Look,  you stupid bastard,  you’ve got no arms left.
Look,  you’re a busy man,  uh...
Look!
Look! The dead Prince!
Loose  “I fart in your general direction”
Lose “oh,  fuck off” 
Lose “the oral sex”
Lose “We make castanets out of your testicles”
Lose as may ‘shits’ as possible
Man,  sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?
Man!
Mind your own business!
More witches!
My liege,  it’s Sir Robin!
My liege! I would be honored.
My liege! It’s good to see you!
My name is Sir Launcelot of Camelot.
Naaah,  I got to go on to the Robinsons’. They’ve lost nine today.
No fear etc.
No I’m not!
No I’m not.
No more close harmony groups!!!
No no,  I want you to stay here and make sure ’e doesn’t leave.
No no,  no.
No one lives there.
No we must be on our way.
No,  I am Zoot’s identical twin sister,  Dingo.
No,  I feel fine,  actually,  sir.
No,  I was saved at the last minute.
No,  it is far from this—
No,  it isn’t.
No,  no—‘ni’. You’re not doing it properly.
No,  no,   just keep him in here—
No,  not ‘is’ We couldn’t get very far in life not saying ‘is’.
No,  they’d have to have it on a line.
No,  we didn’t. Nooo.
No,  we’ve got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!
No,  you’re not. You’ll be stone dead in a moment.
No! Never! No shrubberies!
No! Not the Knights Who Say Ni!
No! Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!
No. It’s too perilous.
No. It’s unhealthy.
None shall pass.
None shall pass.
Not at all,  they could be carried.
Not at all. See you on Thursday.
Not necessarily ... As I say king Brian is much more relaxed than he used to be.
Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.
Nothing. Here’s your nine pence.
Now look here,  my good ma—
Now look,  I can tackle this lot single-handed!
Now stand aside,  worthy adversary.
Now,  this is your last chance. I’ve been more than reasonable.
O Knights of Ni,  we have brought you your shrubbery. May we go now?
O Knights of Ni,  you are just and fair,  and we will return with a shrubbery.
Of course not! You are English types-a!
Of course!
Of course! Joseph of Arimathea!
Of course.
Oh king,  eh? Very nice. An’ how’d you get that,  eh? By exploitin’ the workers,  by ’angin’ on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic an’ social differences in our society! If there’s ever going to be any progress—
Oh Please your majesty! Please!
Oh that was an accident - honestly he’s so calm now oh!
Oh yeah,  yeah...
Oh you’ve GOT to have an AUDIENCE!
Oh,  but you are tired,  and you must rest awhile. 
Oh,  but you must see the doctors immediately!  No,  no,  please, 
Oh,  certainly,  sir.
Oh,  come on!
Oh,  cut your own head off!
Oh,  dear. Is he all right?
Oh,  do us a favor...
Oh,  don’t be such a baby.
Oh,  don’t grovel! If there’s one thing I can’t stand,  it’s people groveling.
Oh,  great.
Oh,  had enough,  eh?
Oh,  hello.
Oh,  I can’t take him like that. It’s against regulations.
Oh,  I see. Right.
Oh,  I won’t go.
Oh,  if-if,  oh—
Oh,  let me have just a little bit of peril?
Oh,  oh,  I see. Running away,  eh? You yellow bastards! Come back here and take what’s coming to ya! I’ll bite y’ legs off!
Oh,  ow!
Oh,  please.
Oh,  quite clear,  no problems.
Oh,  stop it!
Oh,  thank you,  thank you,  splendid,  fine.
Oh,  thank you.
Oh,  there you go,  bringing class into it again.
Oh,  un cadeau.
Oh,  what a giveaway. Did you here that? Did you here that,  eh? That’s what I’m on about. Did you see him repressing me? You saw it didn’t you?
Oh,  wicked,  bad,  naughty Zoot!  She has been setting a light to our beacon,  which,  I just
Oh,  yeah,  an African swallow maybe,  but not a European swallow. That’s my point.
Oh,  yeah,  I agree with that...
Oh,  yeah?
Oh,  yeah.
Oh,  yeah...
Oh,  yes,  it’s very nice-a. I told him we already got one.
Oh,  yes,  of course.  I thought you meant him. Y’know,  it seemed a bit daft,  me havin’ to guard him when he’s a guard.
Oh,  yes,  we’ll keep him in here,  obviously. But if he had to leave and we were with him—
Oh,  yes. Saint Iiiives.
Oh,  you have suffered much! You are delirious!
Oh,  you mean sort of a “Aah!”
Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help! Help! I’m being repressed!
Oh! He said it again!
Oh! I said it again! And again! That’s three times! Ooh!
Oh.... Um,  l-look,  if we built this large wooden badger—
Ohhh...
Old woman!
One that looks nice.
Ooh ... Look if you’re scared ...
Ooh,  I feel much better.
Oooh! My God!
Order,  eh? Who does he think he is?
Perhaps he was dictating.
Please,  please good people. I am in haste. Who lives in that castle?
Please,  please! No more! We will find a shrubbery.
Please,  please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion! Let’s not bicker and argue about ’o killed ’o.
Pretty nice castle,  Camelot. Uh,  pretty good pig country....
Pull the other one!
Quick!
Quiet,  quiet. Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Quite. 
Right,  we’ll stay here until you get back.
Right!  Keep me covered.
Right!  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew comin’

Right. Remove the supports!

So be it!
So they couldn’t bring a coconut back anyway...
So,  how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
So,  why do witches burn?
So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land,  through the kingdom of Mercia,  through—
Some call him that,  but he’s calmed down allot recently.
SORRY,  KING.
Sorry,  King.
Sorry,  sorry. See what I mean? I just get carried away. I really must—  Sorry,  sorry!
Sorry.
Stop that,  stop that! You’re not going to do a song while I’m here. Now listen lad,  in twenty minutes you’re getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.
Stop! Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three,  ere the other side he see.
Surely you’ve not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
Take ‘Jesus Christ’ out,  if possible
Take him away and tie his kidneys to the longest hedge in the kingdom!
Tell me,  what do you do with witches?
Thank goodness.
Thank you,  sir! Most kind.
That is our quest. You know much that is hidden,  O Tim.
That’s what it’s all about! If only people would
That’s— that’s,  uh,  that’s enough music for now,  lads. Looks like there’s dirty work afoot.“DEAD PEOPLE ONLY!
The Black Knight always triumphs! [attempting a head butt] Have at you! Come on then.
The Bridge of Death,  which leads to the Grail?
The Britons.
The Castle Anthrax?
The Grail. It is here?
The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!
The Knights Who Say Ni.
The Lady of the Lake,  her arm clad in the purest,  shimmering samite,  held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I,  ,  was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king!
The nose?
The pond!
The Prince?
The same!
The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter,  yet these are not strangers to our land.
The what?
The wise Sir  was the first to join King ’s knights,  but other illustrious names were soon to follow.
Them? they’re... just to show you where the audience would be.
Then I dub you
Then who is your lord?
Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.  
Then you shall die.
There are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom,  Sir.
There are some who call me...Tim?
There it is! The Bridge of Death!
There!
There’s no Grail here.
Therefore,  we must give you a test.
They cost fifty pounds each!
They dressed me up like this.
They’re nervous,  sire.
THEY’RE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY WITH...
This is the castle of my master,  Guy de Loimbard.
This new learning amazes me,  Sir . Explain again how sheep’s bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
This rabbit—a wooden rabbit
Three questions—as best you can. And we shall watch...and pray.
Three questions—may cross in safety.
Three questions. He who answers the five questions—
Three,  sir.
Three. Three. And we’d better not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit’s dynamite.
Throw her into the pond!
Thursday.
Thus passes the glory of the world. 
Uh,  I-I think uh,  I could pull through,  sir.
Uh,  I,  uh,  leap out of the rabbit,  uh,  and uh....
Uh,  well,  I got a note.
Uh...oh,  yes! Sorry.
Um,  I think when I’m in this idiom,  I sometimes get a bit,  uh,  sort of carried away... [Exit
Until you come and get him,  we’re not to enter the room.
Until you,  or anyone else, —
Very much danger,  for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril,  which no man has ever crossed.
Very small rocks.
Very well! If you will not assist us voluntarily.... Ni!
Victory is mine!
Well,  she turned me into a newt.
Wait a minute! Five point harmony with a counter-tenor lead!
Wait a minute. Supposing two swallows carried it together?
We are now...no longer the Knights Who Say Ni.
We are the keepers of the sacred words
We are the Knights Who Say... Ni!
We don’t have a lord.
We don’t need to do anything,  apart from just stop him entering the room.
We found them.
We have found a witch. May we burn her?
We have scoured the kingdom.
We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
We must examine you.
We shall attack at once!
We shall do no such thing!
We shall say ‘ni’ again to you if you do not appease us.
We shall use my largest scales!
We want...a shrubbery!
We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.
We’d end unlike the Shalott Choral Society.
We’d rather give a private recital.
We’re coming with you.
We’re Knights of the Round Table. We dance whene’er we’re able. We do routines and chorus scenes. With footwork impeccable. We dine well here in Camelot. We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot. Between our quests we sequin vests. And impersonate Clark Gable. It’s a busy life.
We’re not entirely happy with the acoustics.
We’re not SCARED!
Well obviously he’d prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh!
Well taken,  Concorde!
Well we’d prefer to do it without an audience.
Well you can’t expect to wield supreme executive power just ’cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Well,  ’ow did you become king then?
Well,  can you hang around a couple of minutes? He won’t be long.
Well,  don’t. It’s like those miserable Psalms. They’re so depressing. Now knock it off!
Well,  he will be soon. He’s very ill.
Well,  I am king...
Well,  I can explain. I was in the forest,  um,  riding north from Camelot,  when I got this note,  you see—
Well,  I can’t just call you ‘Man.’
Well,  I didn’t know you were called ‘Dennis.’
Well,  I didn’t vote for you.
Well,  I really didn’t mean to...
Well,  I’ll ask him,  but I don’t think he’ll be very keen.... Uh,  he’s already got one,  you see?
Well,  I’ll tell you.
Well,  I’m awfully sorry,  I’m— I really can explain everything.
Well,  it doesn’t matter. Will you go and tell your master that
Well,  look,  I-I-uh—
Well,  now,  uh,  ,  Gallahad,  and I wait until nightfall,  and then leap out of the rabbit,  taking the French by surprise. Not only by surprise,  but totally unarmed!
Well,  on second thought,  let’s not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.
Well,  simple! They’d just use a strand o’ creeper!
Well,  that’s no ordinary rabbit. That’s the most foul,  cruel,  and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.
Well,  that’s,  uh,  awfully nice of you...
Well,  this is a temperate zone.
Well,  um,  can we come up and have a look?
Well,  we all are. We’re all Britons and I am your king.
Well,  we did do the nose.
Well,  what are you then?
Well,  what is it you want?
Well,  when is your next round?
Well,  why not? 
Well,  you could say ‘Dennis.’
Well,  you didn’t bother to find out,  did you?
Well,  you see,  the thing is,  I thought your son was a lady.
What a strange person.
What also floats in water?
What are THEY For? 
What are they?
What are you doing in England?
What are you going to do,  bleed on me?
What do you mean?
What do you mean? An African or European swallow?

oscar_wilde = ['''Lord Henry smiled,  and,  leaning down,  plucked a pinkpetalled daisy from the grass,  and examined it. ‘I am quite sure I shall understand it, ’ he replied,  gazing intently at the little golden white-feathered disk,  ‘and I can believe anything,  provided that it is incredible.’ The wind shook some blossoms from the trees,  and the heavy lilac blooms,  with their clustering stars,  moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup in the grass,  and a long thin dragon-fly floated by on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart beating,  and he wondered what was coming. ‘Well,  this is incredible, ’ repeated Hallward,  rather bitterly, — ‘incredible to me at times. I don’t know what it means. The story is simply this. Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor painters have to show ourselves in society from time to time,  just to remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white tie,  as you told me once,  anybody,  even a stock-broker,  can gain a reputation for being civilized. Well,  after I had been in the room about ten minutes,  talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious Academicians,  I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round,  and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met,  I felt that I was growing pale. A curious instinct of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that,  if I allowed it to do so,  it would absorb my whole nature,  my whole soul,  my very art itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com  yourself,  Harry,  how independent I am by nature. My father destined me for the army. I insisted on going to Oxford. Then he made me enter my name at the Middle Temple. Before I had eaten half a dozen dinners I gave up the Bar,  and announced my intention of becoming a painter. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so,  till I met Dorian Gray. Then—But I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I knew that if I spoke to Dorian I would become absolutely devoted to him,  and that I ought not to speak to him. I grew afraid,  and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do so: it was cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.’ ‘Conscience and cowardice are really the same things,  Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.’ ‘I don’t believe that,  Harry. However,  whatever was my motive, — and it may have been pride,  for I used to be very proud, —I certainly struggled to the door. There,  of course,  I stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,  Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her shrill horrid voice?’ ‘Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty, ’ said Lord Henry,  pulling the daisy to bits with his long,  nervous fingers. ‘I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to Royalties,  and people with Stars and Garters,  and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and hooked noses. She spoke of me as   The Picture of Dorian Gray her dearest friend. I had only met her once before,  but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time,  at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers,  which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me. We were quite close,  almost touching. Our eyes met again. It was mad of me,  but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not so mad,  after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He,  too,  felt that we were destined to know each other.’ ‘And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man? I know she goes in for giving a rapid précis of all her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a most truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons,  and hissing into my ear,  in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room,  something like ‘Sir Humpty Dumpty—you know—Afghan frontier—Russian intrigues: very successful man—wife killed by an elephant—quite inconsolable— wants to marry a beautiful American widow—everybody does nowadays—hates Mr. Gladstone—but very much interested in beetles: ask him what he thinks of ’ I simply fled. I like to find out people for myself. But poor Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them entirely away,  or tells one everything about them except what one wants to Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com    know. But what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?’ ‘Oh,  she murmured,  ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I quite inseparable—engaged to be married to the same man—I mean married on the same day—how very silly of me! Quite forget what he does— afraid he—doesn’t do anything—oh,  yes,  plays the piano—or is it the violin,  dear Mr. Gray?’ We could neither of us help laughing,  and we became friends at once.’ ‘Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship,  and it is the best ending for one, ’ said Lord Henry,  plucking another daisy. Hallward buried his face in his hands. ‘You don’t understand what friendship is,  Harry, ’ he murmured, —‘or what enmity is,  for that matter. You like every one; that is to say,  you are indifferent to every one.’ ‘How horribly unjust of you!’ cried Lord Henry,  tilting his hat back,  and looking up at the little clouds that were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky,  like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk. ‘Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks,  my acquaintances for their characters,  and my enemies for their brains. A man can’t be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power,  and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.’ ‘I should think it was,  Harry. But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.’ ‘My dear old Basil,  you are much more’ ‘And much less than a friend. A sort of brother,  I suppose?’ ‘Oh,  brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,  and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.’ ‘Harry!’ ‘My dear fellow,  I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that we can’t stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper classes. They feel that drunkenness,  stupidity,  and immorality should be their own special property,  and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the Divorce Court,  their indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the lower orders live correctly.’ ‘I don’t agree with a single word that you have said,  and,  what is more,  Harry,  I don’t believe you do either.’ Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard,  and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled malacca cane. ‘How English you are,  Basil! If one puts forward an idea to a real Englishman, — always a rash thing to do, — he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it one’s self. Now,  the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed,  the probabilities are that the more Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com   insincere the man is,  the more purely intellectual will the idea be,  as in that case it will not be colored by either his wants,  his desires,  or his prejudices. However,  I don’t propose to discuss politics,  sociology,  or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than principles. Tell me more about Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?’ ‘Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. Of course sometimes it is only for a few minutes. But a few minutes with somebody one worships mean a great deal.’ ‘But you don’t really worship him?’ ‘I do.’ ‘How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your painting, —your art,  I should say. Art sounds better,  doesn’t it?’ ‘He is all my art to me now. I sometimes think,  Harry,  that there are only two eras of any importance in the history of the world. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,  and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians,  the face of Antinoüs was to late Greek sculpture,  and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him,  draw from him,  model from him. Of course I have done all that. He has stood as Paris in dainty armor,  and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boarspear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms,  he has sat on the prow of Adrian’s barge,  looking into the green,  turbid Nile. He has leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland,  and seen in the water’s silent silver   The Picture of Dorian Gray the wonder of his own beauty. But he is much more to me than that. I won’t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him,  or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,  and I know that the work I have done since I met Dorian Gray is good work,  is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art,  an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently,  I think of them differently. I can now re-create life in a way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of thought, ’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad,  —for he seems to me little more than a lad,  though he is really over twenty, —his merely visible presence, —ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school,  a school that is to have in itself all the passion of the romantic spirit,  all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body, —how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two,  and have invented a realism that is bestial,  an ideality that is void. Harry! Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine,  for which Agnew offered me such a huge price,  but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so? Because,  while I was painting it,  Dorian Gray sat beside me.’ ‘Basil,  this is quite wonderful! I must see Dorian Gray.’ Hallward got up from the seat,  and walked up and down Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com   the garden. After some time he came back. ‘You don’t understand,  Harry, ’ he said. ‘Dorian Gray is merely to me a motive in art. He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there. He is simply a suggestion,  as I have said,  of a new manner. I see him in the curves of certain lines,  in the loveliness and the subtleties of certain colors. That is all.’ ‘Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?’ ‘Because I have put into it all the extraordinary romance of which,  of course,  I have never dared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He will never know anything about it. But the world might guess it; and I will not bare my soul to their shallow,  prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing,  Harry, —too much of myself!’ ‘Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.’ ‘I hate them for it. An artist should create beautiful things,  but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. If I live,  I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.’ ‘I think you are wrong,  Basil,  but I won’t argue with you. It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me,  is Dorian Gray very fond of you?’ Hallward considered for a few moments. ‘He likes me, ’   The Picture of Dorian Gray he answered,  after a pause; ‘I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said. I give myself away. As a rule,  he is charming to me,  and we walk home together from the club arm in arm,  or sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then,  however,  he is horribly thoughtless,  and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel,  Harry,  that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat,  a bit of decoration to charm his vanity,  an ornament for a summer’s day.’ ‘Days in summer,  Basil,  are apt to linger. Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think of,  but there is no doubt that Genius lasts longer than Beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence,  we want to have something that endures,  and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts,  in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well informed man, —that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-à-brac shop,  all monsters and dust,  and everything priced above its proper value. I think you will tire first,  all the same. Some day you will look at Gray,  and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing,  or you won’t like his tone of color,  or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart,  and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls,  you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity,  for it will alter you. The worst of having a ro- Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com   mance is that it leaves one so unromantic.’ ‘Harry,  don’t talk like that. As long as I live,  the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change too often.’ ‘Ah,  my dear Basil,  that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the pleasures of love: it is the faithless who know love’s tragedies.’ And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case,  and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and self-satisfied air,  as if he had summed up life in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the ivy,  and the blue cloudshadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas,  it seemed to him. One’s own soul,  and the passions of one’s friends, —those were the fascinating things in life. He thought with pleasure of the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s,  he would have been sure to meet Lord Goodbody there,  and the whole conversation would have been about the housing of the poor,  and the necessity for model lodging-houses. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt,  an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to Hallward,  and said,  ‘My dear fellow,  I have just remembered.’ ‘Remembered what,  Harry?’ ‘Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.’ ‘Where was it?’ asked Hallward,  with a slight frown. ‘Don’t look so angry,  Basil. It was at my aunt’s,  Lady Ag-   The Picture of Dorian Gray atha’s. She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man,  who was going to help her in the East End,  and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation of good looks. At least,  good women have not. She said that he was very earnest,  and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair,  horridly freckled,  and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.’ ‘I am very glad you didn’t,  Harry.’ ‘Why?’ ‘I don’t want you to meet him.’ ‘Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio,  sir, ’ said the butler,  coming into the garden. ‘You must introduce me now, ’ cried Lord Henry,  laughing. Basil Hallward turned to the servant,  who stood blinking in the sunlight. ‘Ask Mr. Gray to wait,  Parker: I will be in in a few moments.’ The man bowed,  and went up the walk. Then he looked at Lord Henry. ‘Dorian Gray is my dearest friend, ’ he said. ‘He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him for me. Don’t try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide,  and has many marvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person that makes life absolutely lovely to me,  and that gives to my art whatever wonder or charm it possesses. Mind,  Harry,  I trust you.’ He spoke very slowly,  and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will. Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com   ‘What nonsense you talk!’ said Lord Henry,  smiling,  and,  taking Hallward by the arm,  he almost led him into the house.  The Picture of Dorian Gray Chapter II As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano,  with his back to them,  turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s ‘Forest Scenes.’ ‘You must lend me these,  Basil, ’ he cried. ‘I want to learn them. They are perfectly charming.’ ‘That entirely depends on how you sit to-day,  Dorian.’ ‘Oh,  I am tired of sitting,  and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of myself, ’ answered the lad,  swinging round on the music-stool,  in a wilful,  petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry,  a faint blush colored his cheeks for a moment,  and he started up. ‘I beg your pardon,  Basil,  but I didn’t know you had any one with you.’ ‘This is Lord Henry Wotton,  Dorian,  an old Oxford friend of mine. I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were,  and now you have spoiled everything.’ ‘You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you,  Mr. Gray, ’ said Lord Henry,  stepping forward and shaking him by the hand. ‘My aunt has often spoken to me about you. You are one of her favorites,  and,  I am afraid,  one of her victims also.’ ‘I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present, ’ answered Dorian,  with a funny look of penitence. ‘I promised to go to her club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday,  and I really forgot all about it. We were to have played a duet together, — Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com   three duets,  I believe. I don’t know what she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.’ ‘Oh,  I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you. And I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people.’ ‘That is very horrid to her,  and not very nice to me, ’ answered Dorian,  laughing. Lord Henry looked at him. Yes,  he was certainly wonderfully handsome,  with his finely-curved scarlet lips,  his frank blue eyes,  his crisp gold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at once. All the candor of youth was there,  as well as all youth’s passionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted''']
