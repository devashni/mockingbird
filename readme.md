## Project: Mockingbird
## Brief 
Mockingbird is a markov chain based text generation and algorithm visualization, because seeing is understanding. It's a full-stack web application.

## Description
The Mockingbird web app uses a Markov chain based text generation algorithm to generate random believable sentences mimicking the style of the original author. The ‘source text’ can be pulled from live tweets off Twitter for up to two different sources or selected from the app database. Sentences based on one person’s tweets can be entertaining but throwing in interesting personalities to the mix can produce compelling and often hilarious results.

Users can enable or disable visualization of the steps of the text generation algorithm, change visualization speed, save generated text and create word clouds to analyze and compare tweets/text (including emojis!) from multiple authors. Use it for fun or use it for education!
